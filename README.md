Resolution of challenges that I encountered from the challenge  [codember](https://codember.dev/) created by [@midudev](https://github.com/midudev/) for community.
The programming challenges that are carried out in the month of November come out every week with challenges, but in this repository for personal reasons we will only dedicate ourselves to solving them.
